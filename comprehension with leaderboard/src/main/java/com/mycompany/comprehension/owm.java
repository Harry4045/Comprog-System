        jTextArea1.setText("\"The victory of the small Greek democracy of Athens over the mighty Persian Empire in 490 B.C. is one of the \nmost famous events in history. Darius, king of the Persian Empire, was furious \nbecause Athens had interceded for the other Greek city-states in revolt against Persian domination. In anger the \nking sent an enormous army to defeat Athens. He thought it would take drastic steps to pacify the rebellious \npart of the empire.\n\n\"Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citizens helped to rule. Ennobled by this participation, \nAthenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at \nMarathon, which freed them from Persian rule. On their way to Marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek \ncity-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened citizens of Delos refused to believe this. Not \nwanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. \nThey were wise, for the Persians next conquered the city of Eritrea and captured its people.\n\n\"Tiny Athens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people went to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for \ndeliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and \nmoved to the plain of Marathon, where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers \nfrom Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops.\"\n\n\"The Athenian army attacked, and Greek citizens fought bravely. The power of the mighty Persians was offset by \nthe love that the Athenians had for their city. Athenians defeated the Persians in both archery and hand combat. \nGreek soldiers seized Persian ships and burned them, and the Persians fled in terror. Herodotus, a famous \nhistorian, reports that 6,400 Persians\ndied, compared to only 192 Athenians.\"\n\"One of the most intriguing stories of the Russian Revolution concerns the identity of Anastasia, the youngest daughter of \nCzar Nicholas II. During his reign over Russia, the czar had planned to revoke many of the harsh laws established by previous \nczars. Some workers and peasants, however, clamored for more rapid social reform. In 1918, a group of these people \nknown as Bolsheviks overthrew the government. On July 17 or 18, they murdered the czar and what was thought to be his \nentire family.\"\n\n\"Although witnesses vouched that all the members of the czar’s family had been executed, there were rumors suggesting that \nAnastasia had survived. Over the years, a number of women claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. Perhaps the most famous \nclaimant was Anastasia Tschaikovsky, who was also known as Anna Anderson.\n\n\"In 1920, 18 months after the czar’s execution, this terrified young woman was rescued from drowning in a Berlin river. She spent \ntwo years in a hospital, where she attempted to reclaim her health and shattered mind. The doctors and nurses thought that she \nresembled Anastasia and questioned her about her background. She disclaimed any connection with the czar’s family. \nEight years later, however, she claimed that she was Anastasia. She said that she had been rescued by two Russian soldiers after \nthe czar and the rest of her family had been killed. Two brothers named Tschaikovsky had carried her into Romania. She had married \none of the brothers, who had taken her to Berlin and left her there, penniless and without a vocation. Unable to invoke the aid of her \nmother’s family in Germany, she had tried to drown herself.\n\n\"During the next few years, scores of the czar’s relatives, ex-servants, and acquaintances interviewed her. Many of these people said \nthat her looks and mannerisms were evocative of the Anastasia that they had known. Her grandmother and other relatives denied that \nshe was the real Anastasia, however. Tired of being accused of fraud, Anastasia immigrated to the United States in 1928 and took the \nname Anna Anderson. She still wished to prove that she was Anastasia, though, and returned to Germany in 1933 to bring suit against\nher mother’s family. There she declaimed to the court, asserting that she was indeed Anastasia and deserved her inheritance.\"\n\n\"In 1957, the court decided that it could neither confirm nor deny Anastasia’s identity. Although it will probably never be known\nwhether this woman was the Grand Duchess Anastasia, her search to establish her identity has been the subject of numerous books, plays, and \nmovies.\"");
